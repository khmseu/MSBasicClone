 *
 * Current architecture note:
 * - Many concrete Statement subclasses are defined close to the parsing logic
 *   in [src/parser.cpp](src/parser.cpp). This keeps statement construction and
 *   statement behavior co-located, which simplifies compatibility work while
 *   the interpreter evolves.
 *
 * If/when statement classes are refactored out of the parser, their
 * implementations can move into this file.
